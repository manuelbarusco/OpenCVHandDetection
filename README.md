# OpenCV Hand Detection and Segmentation System
This is an OpenCV Students Project about an hand detection and segmentation system that can detect and segments hands from an image. The system is based on a YOLO v3 network for the detection and on an ad-hoc version of the Grab Cut algorithm in order to segment the hand from the YOLO output bounding box (The YOLO weights are not present in the repository). 

In this repository you can find in the <code>Project</code> folder all the code for executing the system. The code is divided into header and source code. The test folder contains some test images and a simple directories backbone for a test execution of the code. All the details of the execution are provided in the report file.
