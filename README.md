# OpenCVHandDetection
OpenCV Students Project of an hand detection and segmentation system. The system is based on a YOLO v3 network for the detection and on an ad-hoc version of the Grab Cut algorithm in order to segment the hand from the YOLO output bounding box. 

On this repository you can find on the <code>Project</code> folder all the code for executing the system. The code is divided into header and source code. The test folder contains some test images and a simple directories backbone for a test execution of the code. All the details of the execution are provided in the report file.
